309,2020-01-28 19:48:00,Tushar Nankani,Because it enters the loop because of k. And i gets printed too. 
310,2020-01-28 19:49:00,Tushar Nankani,The condition of k becomes true and therefore it enters the loop. From 2 to 20 with a gap of 2. Therefore it enters 10 times and i gets printed instead from 1-10 
311,2020-01-28 19:50:00,"Saket (TSEC, CS)",So conclusion is If there are multiple conditions in a single ' for loop' then even if one statement is satisfied then loop will run for that condition.

When assigned to int, 25.0000000001 becomes 25 but 24.9999999 will give output 24. To overcome this and output the accurate answer in integer format, we can add 0.5 to the result and typecast it to int e.g (int)(pow(5, 2)+0.5) will give the correct answer(25, in above example), irrespective of the compiler.

635,2020-02-08 22:35:00,+91 89764 07509,for int byte size req is 2 so since 1 byte =8 bits hence 2bytes=16 bits

Reason why I am telling u this is because many people just do it because their classmates are doing CP and they appear to be alien in that field which is not the correct reason to do something. Let me tell u one thing very honestly if u want job in product based companies of Software development engineer position u need to have good problem solving skills at any cost whatsoever and excellent knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. If u are doing CP like I opened my laptop today and I am opening it after 20 days it's not gonna work like that way if ur serious about CP then u have to chalk a good week plan be consistent and steadfast in it. Sometimes it may happen that u become demotivated and left CP for a month or so BUT it should happen only sometimes and u should try to come back as soon as possible 2. How to start , learn only C++ and do CP only in C++. C++ is the best language for CP. 3. For those who don't want to go for any course(which I don't recommend) Check out this video  https://youtu.be/4VD5wpLq1EQ  This video is by karan Gujar from Thakur college of Engineering  I know him personally. We were preparing for IIT together in RIIT classes Now he is a 6th star coder on codechef  Follow each and every point he told in the video.  Also follow him on quora for various answers and medium for his blog posts and tutorials.  Second person  Rachit jain Ex Microsoft Engineer 6th star coder at codechef follow his YouTube channel for guidance and specially his video  how I mastered Data Structures and Algorithms "

It's very unfortunate thing that has happened and I my advice my fellow programming aspirants don't rush behind ratings, stars red coder etc focus on becoming a good programmer each day and try to learn new things all this ratings stars etc will come with time but u should not be ready to compromise ur ethics and values just for the sake of Show off and publicity because its not going to help in the long run.

4974,2020-04-18 23:12:00,+91 73043 57388,The problems on finding subsets are usually called combination of numbers problem  For finding subsets u simply combine the concept of iteration and recursion   For that u have to create 2 arrays one will be having all given numbers Second array will be temporary array which is going to hold every possible subset by taking each number of the given array one by one  So suppose u have  Given array 1 2 3 4 And u wan to find all possible subsets  We use a for loop for traversing through the given loop  For(i=0;i<n;i++) {     temp[0]=arr[i];    Recursion_func }  We draw a recursion tree for that

In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren't always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy. After extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus Today I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.  Repository Link- https://github.com/DarshanDeshpande/COVID-19-Detector  A small version of the dataset on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/covid19-detection-xray-dataset  Thank you for your time!

5537,2020-04-30 19:52:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",is it better to implement a Deque using ArrayList or LinkedList?I just wanted to know as im new to DS 
5538,2020-04-30 20:42:00,+91 98331 51331,LinkedList I suppose 
5539,2020-04-30 20:42:00,+91 98331 51331,Easier insertions and deletions of elements 
5540,2020-04-30 20:42:00,+91 98331 51331,Also sorting

Since the size of numbers is huge, we can't make use of the primary memory to serve the purpose. 1) Divide the numbers in group of k. 2) Sort each group independently in O(klogk). ( using internal sort - Quick Sort )     Merge sort all the groups. 3) Create a min heap of size=10 billion/k. 4) Update the min heap with the minimum from each group. 5) Extract the minimum from the heap and write to a file. 6) Get the next number from the group from which extracted number belonged. 7) Update the min heap. 8) Go to step 5.    *Approach 2:- Using Doubly Ended Priority Queue (DEPQ)*  1) Read in as many elements as will fit into DEPQ.    The elements in DEPQ will eventually be the middle group of elements. 2) Proces the remaining elements one at a time.    If the next element <= smallest element in the DEPQ, output this element as a part of the left group.    Else if the next element is greater  than the largest element in DEPQ, output it as a part of right group. 3) Otherwise, remove  either the min or max element from the DEPQ. 4) Output the elements in DEPQ in sorted order. 5) Sort the left and right groups recursively.  _In approach 2, we are simulating the quick sort, In quick sort , the array is broken into  L,M,R._ _where M is just a single pivot element. But in approach 2 , the whole DEPQ is acting as a pivot._ "

6684,2020-05-28 02:34:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",You can achieve the same outcome with 0.1% of the code. 
6685,2020-05-28 02:34:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","And I am not even joking, try measuring code coverage in DevTools. "
6686,2020-05-28 02:34:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",What is a CDN is used? 
6687,2020-05-28 02:34:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",If*

6690,2020-05-28 02:35:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",A CDN can only speed up the download times. 
6691,2020-05-28 02:36:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",What I meant that most (small) projects do not even use 2-5% of the code in a huge library like jQuery or BootStrap. 
6692,2020-05-28 02:37:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",
6693,2020-05-28 02:37:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","So even if you are using a CDN, and the library is 10,000 lines, then you are only using 100-150 lines. "
6694,2020-05-28 02:38:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Which seems like a MASSIVE waste. 
6695,2020-05-28 02:38:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","It's so garbage that if I used it in my full stack project, no one would come back to it "

6697,2020-05-28 02:38:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",The entire lib is called even when just a particular class is called? 
6698,2020-05-28 02:40:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","If you include a script/library with a <script> or <link> tag, the ENTIRE file is downloaded even if you don't use a single line. "
6699,2020-05-28 02:40:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","The Browser does not know what you will use, so it HAS to download, parse and execute the entire library. "
6700,2020-05-28 02:40:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Oh yeah ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
6701,2020-05-28 02:40:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",True true 
6702,2020-05-28 02:41:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","However, there is something called ""Tree Shaking"" where unused portions of the library are removed. "
6703,2020-05-28 02:42:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But even that is not as efficient because sometimes one function can call half the library. 
6704,2020-05-28 02:42:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Ohh 
6705,2020-05-28 02:42:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",And you lose the benefit of a CDN. 
6706,2020-05-28 02:43:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",? 
6707,2020-05-28 02:44:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","OK, what backend functionality? "

6713,2020-05-28 02:45:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","For v2, we are making the front end ourselves and have redesigned the back end... "
6714,2020-05-28 02:47:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","OK, if you are building a REST API, then by all means use BootStrap or Materialize for the demo website. "
6715,2020-05-28 02:48:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But you can still have a great website WITHOUT BootStrap. 
6716,2020-05-28 02:48:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","Now here we are using Bootstrap and when we add Flexbox, it fucks up the Bootstrap "

7064,2020-06-05 17:52:00,+91 99693 94098,True. Mi is so shit that you have to ask for their permission for bootloader unlock and uske baad bhi you have to wait for a minimum of 15days before you can actually do it. Biggest scam ever 
7065,2020-06-05 17:53:00,+91 97681 67131,I loved their irony buying ripapple.com and rip Samsung.com and selling their refurbished phones only by rebranding themüòÇüòÇ 
7066,2020-06-05 17:54:00,+91 88798 05171,But they have everything you want 
7067,2020-06-05 17:54:00,+91 97681 67131,These days I think all phones do it started by moto and Lenovo but it improves Androids privacy by having a locked bootloader it‚Äôs actually good as it makes hard to exploit a device with locked bootloader 
7068,2020-06-05 17:55:00,+91 88798 05171,There's no developement for op7

7070,2020-06-05 17:56:00,+91 99693 94098,15 days wait time for a phone that I bought? Why can't I just unlock it immediately if I want to? Your device is linked to your mi account anyway so there's no way anyone else can do it 
7071,2020-06-05 17:56:00,+91 99693 94098,There is so much development for op7 
7072,2020-06-05 17:57:00,+91 99693 94098,I know like 3-4 main devs that develop for op7 
7073,2020-06-05 17:57:00,+91 88798 05171,Thats for pro 
7074,2020-06-05 17:57:00,+91 99693 94098,Nahi nahi

7078,2020-06-05 18:01:00,+91 99693 94098,I know op7 ka PE dev. Baalaji. He used to develop for my device before 
7079,2020-06-05 18:01:00,+91 97681 67131,Moto and pixel give code immediately though. See bootloader is a integral part of os without its correct flashing device does not work. If ur device came with preunlocked bootloader biggest issue comes with sim locked devices in USA they can be easily exploited and this is how telephone providers were loosing lot of money. This is when moto started with locked bootloader and see xda forums nobody has found exploit for it yet. Also unlocked bootloader gives u permission to flash custom recovery after custom recovery u install custom rom and bam u bypass mi account wala lock and now u can use the stolen phones that‚Äôs the reason locked bootloader are better 
7080,2020-06-05 18:02:00,+91 97681 67131,Lineage OS surely would be there as lots of old CYnogen mod developers working on lineage OS and one plus and cynogen go way back

7082,2020-06-05 18:04:00,+91 99693 94098,"I know this re üòÇüòÇ I'm saying that all phones have a security check before you can unlock(some kind of login or something) so no random person can do it. If you're giving your login credentials and you're still not able to unlock the bootloader immediately then what's the use?  Flashing a custom recovery, etc comes much later. ADB doesn't allow that anyway before you unlock the bootlader "

I have created a telegram group ( as we can pin resources and important stuff also people who join later can refer to old material easily ) for the same.  Also I was thinking it‚Äôll be great if we put up our projects on GitHub as it‚Äôll help us keep a record of our progress so Harsh Kapadia‚Å© has decided to help us with Git and GitHub. He will be taking a live hands on session tomorrow(ie Sunday) and I have posted a poll  regarding the same there please join the group and vote so we know when to keep the session   https://t.me/joinchat/K0eakBhoBEu3ktTwM3cLtg

8165,2020-06-28 21:23:00,+91 75078 05454,This looks interesting. But it looks like a customisable yet limited platform specifically created for development of apps for internal business use something like a project management app. 
8166,2020-06-28 21:25:00,+91 75078 05454,It's an interesting move of Amazon's part. They are trying to migrate people who are using Google docs or microsoft excel to this platform which is powered by AWS. 
8167,2020-06-28 21:25:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",How exactly/ 
8168,2020-06-28 21:26:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","This is an app development platform, right? "
8169,2020-06-28 21:26:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Not an Excel or Google Sheets clone. 
8170,2020-06-28 21:29:00,+91 75078 05454,Businesses use spreadsheets for managing projects that is what they are trying to replace. 
8171,2020-06-28 21:29:00,+91 75078 05454,Not something like data analysis or financial analysis done using spreadsheets 
8172,2020-06-28 21:33:00,+91 75078 05454,They are basically trying to solve the problem of using spreadsheets where they are not supposed to be conventionally used .

8181,2020-06-28 21:53:00,+91 75078 05454,What is your opinion? 
8182,2020-06-28 22:02:00,+91 75078 05454,The real goal is definitely not to be an excel clone but to provide an effective way of creating apps for internal operations 
8183,2020-06-28 22:03:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",My point exactly. 
8184,2020-06-28 22:04:00,+91 75078 05454,But they are going to have a huge advantage once the entire company moves to their platform for all internal operations 
8185,2020-06-28 22:04:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","While this is certainly possible, I don't think that this is the first use-case to come to mind. "
8186,2020-06-28 22:05:00,+91 75078 05454,? 
8187,2020-06-28 22:07:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","I mean that it is possible to do data-analysis and manage projects on the platform, but that is not what I would use the platform for. "
8188,2020-06-28 22:08:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I would use it for rapid prototypes and proof of concepts. 
8189,2020-06-28 22:08:00,+91 75078 05454,That's definitely a very good use case but depends on the capability of the platform 
8190,2020-06-28 22:09:00,+91 75078 05454,From their campaign it looks like a platform for making apps for internal operations for businesses 
8191,2020-06-28 22:10:00,+91 75078 05454,But there is definitely a possibility of that turning into something like WordPress 
8192,2020-06-28 22:11:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I feel that Wordpress gained it's popularity because it was so open. 
8193,2020-06-28 22:12:00,+91 75078 05454,That's what I am saying the range of use cases will depend upon the flexibility of the platform 
8194,2020-06-28 22:13:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",That is true. 
8195,2020-06-28 22:14:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But I don't think that companies will be willing to trust Amazon with their business logic. 
8196,2020-06-28 22:15:00,+91 75078 05454,Yeah that's true

8564,2020-07-07 21:21:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Idleness limit exceeded occurs when your program stays idle (waiting for user/interaction program) for long time.  I'm not sure why is it not WA instead of Idleness limit exceeded. My guess is that interaction program expects a newline and thus keeps on waiting for your program.

8741,2020-07-10 19:21:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",What is HomeBrew ? Is this for Mac only? 
8742,2020-07-10 19:21:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Not technially, no. "
8743,2020-07-10 19:22:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It was developed as a package mangager for Mac. 
8744,2020-07-10 19:22:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",But what is HomeBrew? 
8745,2020-07-10 19:22:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Similar to apt and apk. 
8746,2020-07-10 19:22:00,+91 97681 67131,Package manager like Linux has apt... 
8747,2020-07-10 19:22:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Exactly. 
8748,2020-07-10 19:23:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It is also availiable for linux. 
8749,2020-07-10 19:24:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","It has limited use, except in very rare situations. One thing it does differently is it installs all software to the USER's partition instead of system. "
8750,2020-07-10 19:24:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Means you don't have to be root to install software. 
8751,2020-07-10 19:25:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","You can ""isolate"" brew to one directory and it will not touch anything outside that directory. "
8752,2020-07-10 19:25:00,+91 97681 67131,Are u trying to install git?? That‚Äôs why asking for home brew? For example if I needed to install git on OS X u can use home brew as ur package manager. This will automatically install all the Xcode command line tools recquired for git to run on ur mac 
8753,2020-07-10 19:26:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah 
8754,2020-07-10 19:26:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Oh acha 
8755,2020-07-10 19:28:00,+91 97681 67131,"Thought so, I also did the same recently üòÖ. Anyway, instead of manually installing full Xcode and command line tools, this package manager will only install the needed libraries for vcs system like git to work on OS X "
8756,2020-07-10 19:28:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I think you can just do ```git``` on the command line and it will propmpt for installation. 
8757,2020-07-10 19:28:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_macos 
8758,2020-07-10 19:28:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeahh thats what i did 
8759,2020-07-10 19:28:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah 
8760,2020-07-10 19:28:00,+91 97681 67131,I don‚Äôt think that works in terminal on OSX 
8761,2020-07-10 19:29:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",not only git i did 'brew install git' 
8762,2020-07-10 19:31:00,+91 97681 67131,"Did u first try installing homebrew, wait I‚Äôll share tutorials I followed... just a sec "
8763,2020-07-10 19:31:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah i installed HomeBrew first 
8764,2020-07-10 19:31:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",then through terminal i did brew install git 
8765,2020-07-10 19:32:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)","but it seems ki when you install Xcode , git gets installed too "
8766,2020-07-10 19:32:00,+91 97681 67131,"Oh then do u have Xcode installed and before that pls check software update section, command line tools installing happens from there... "
8767,2020-07-10 19:32:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah i have Xcode 
8768,2020-07-10 19:33:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Software update section? 
8769,2020-07-10 19:33:00,+91 97681 67131,"Nope it‚Äôs not needed to install Xcode just command line tools are necessary mostly but check software update section, they are installed from there "
8770,2020-07-10 19:33:00,+91 97681 67131,I mean where u get os updates 
8771,2020-07-10 19:34:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",It just shows Your mac is up to date 
8772,2020-07-10 19:35:00,+91 97681 67131,Try running git‚Äîversion command is it giving back any version or no ?? If not I think some installing issue.. I will find tutorial I used. 
8773,2020-07-10 19:36:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah it gives the version number 
8774,2020-07-10 19:36:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",git is installed 
8775,2020-07-10 19:36:00,+91 97681 67131,Then it‚Äôs installed 
8776,2020-07-10 19:36:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",just wanted to know about Home Brew 
8777,2020-07-10 19:36:00,+91 97681 67131,Oh üòÇ Ya oh I thought stuck with installing 
8778,2020-07-10 19:37:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",loll 
8779,2020-07-10 19:37:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",XCode has old packages sometimes. Note that the latest git version is 2.27.0. 
8780,2020-07-10 19:38:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",I'll check 
8781,2020-07-10 19:38:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",just a sec 
8782,2020-07-10 19:38:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yup its 2.27.0 
8783,2020-07-10 19:38:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Great! 
8784,2020-07-10 19:39:00,+91 97681 67131,"Homebrew is just a command line package manager like Kartik and I said what we have in in Linux, like apt, debians dpkg etc "
8785,2020-07-10 19:39:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Thanks @918080142783 and @919768167131 ! 
8786,2020-07-10 19:39:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah abhi i got to know

8789,2020-07-10 19:39:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",No problem. 
8790,2020-07-10 19:40:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Just a side note, dpkg is just a package installer, it will not download dependencies. "
8791,2020-07-10 19:40:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",apt uses dpkg internally. 
8792,2020-07-10 19:40:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",It went over my head lol 
8793,2020-07-10 19:40:00,+91 97681 67131,Ya ya.. it‚Äôs installer sorry 
8794,2020-07-10 19:42:00,+91 97681 67131,But ig installers can be considered a part of package manger.. right?? 
8795,2020-07-10 19:43:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Basically if you do ``apt install git``` then it will automatically download and install git, curl and all the other dependencies. But for dpkg, you have to manually download git.deb, curl.deb, etc. and install them one by one in the correct order. "
8796,2020-07-10 19:43:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Yes, definately. Package installers are the most important part of a package manager. "

9541,2020-08-10 11:58:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Find your PC's (local) IP address. 
9542,2020-08-10 11:58:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Then go to that ip address + port number. 
9543,2020-08-10 11:58:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",If you are on wifi enable port forwarding 
9544,2020-08-10 11:58:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",And do this

11127,2020-09-03 12:51:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",It's to clear the channel. The previous input ka enter is still in the channel And if I don't give s.nextLine();  Before the string input  Vo enter gets stored in the string ka variable   So isliye  To avoid that.

11145,2020-09-03 12:55:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","```nextInt()``` will try to find an *Integer token*, while ignoring any whitespace. "
11146,2020-09-03 12:56:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",An Integer token is defined as ```/(+|-)?\d+/```

11150,2020-09-03 12:57:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",
11151,2020-09-03 12:58:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Again, we must understand what the ```nextLine()``` method does. "
11152,2020-09-03 12:59:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","```nextLine()``` is actually a special method, that breaks the boundries of a tokenizer. "
11153,2020-09-03 13:00:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","It simply starts reading from the current point, and returns *all characters* till it finds a newline (```\n```). "
11154,2020-09-03 13:00:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",(without the newline) 
11155,2020-09-03 13:01:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","So calling ```nextLine()``` on ```\nHello, World!\n``` will start reading, the stop at the first character because it is a newline. "
11156,2020-09-03 13:01:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",So basically  It returned nothing in my case 
11157,2020-09-03 13:01:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Which means it will return an empty string.

A car horn isn't of a low amplitude. It might also lead to destructive interference or noise distortion. It's not as easy as using a simple filter to filter out every kind of noise "
12266,2020-09-14 12:23:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But what I don't like about ML/AI articles is they make it look like a magic silver bullet that can solve all problems.

I realise the tradeoff of each implementation but I don't think it supposed to be in the article. The goal isn't to compare. Its to show how it can be done and how the problems can be addressed

Google Cloud Crash Course program will provide engineering students an opportunity to kickstart their learning on cloud technology using practice on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.  Each campus can nominate one person to be a facilitator and lead this initiative in their college. Upon nomination and selection, these facilitators will receive some training on how to lead these sessions and motivate more students to participate.  If anyone here has some familiarity with cloud and is interested to become a facilitator, dm me. "
